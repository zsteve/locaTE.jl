# locaTE

locaTE is a method for context-specific network inference using _local transfer entropy_, 
which uses inferred information about cellular dynamics (RNA velocity, optimal transport, pseudotime, etc.) 
to estimate directional information transfer between genes. 

For a detailed discussion of the method, please see our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.08.523176v1):
